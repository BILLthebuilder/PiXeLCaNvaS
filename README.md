This is the final project for the Andela Learning Community(ALC 3.0) on the front-end web developer track It consists of an app where a user can make a grid of squares to a maximum of 50 X 50 and use the colour selector to make awesome designs. The UI is built using HTML and CSS. The grid is implemented using javascript and Jquery(https://api.jquery.com/) which is used to manipulate the DOM.
